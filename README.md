# Dinosaurs Infographic

## About this project
That's a really interesting project, where you can compare yourself with a dinosaur. For instance, you can compare your height(meter or feet), your weight(kg or lbs) and your diet(herbavor, omnivor, carnivor). This is a project for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Nanodegree *Intermediate JavaScript*.

## Tools
I've used *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript*, and also *JSON*. I also worked on this project, using the Object-Oriented paradigm(OOP).
